# Investment Assignment 2024 Part 2 in Python

Hello dear grader! In order to use this script we need the following dependencies:

- pandas
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib

We used the following versions:

- pandas == 1.5.2
- numpy == 1.25.1
- scipy == 1.9.3
- matplotlib == 3.7.1

But it should work with the default versions you have installed as well since we don't do anything crazy after all.

For exercise 3c the calculations might take a while, but it's fine!

Have a great day!
